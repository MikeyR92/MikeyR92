- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MikeyR92
I am a multifaceted audio engineer, sound designer, and composer. 
Whilst I specialise mostly in game audio design, 
I have been part of many exciting projects published across various
marketplaces and differing forms of media. 
Whilst working mostly in a sound designer capacity I have also taken on compositional, 
mix engineering, audio implementation, and audio editing work. 
I truly enjoy finding creative strategies to fulfill the briefs I am set and 
am always on the lookout for the next exciting production that I feel my contribution 
will leave a stamp of my style on. 

I completed my audio engineering degree at SAE London with first honors, 
focusing my final projects on interactive audio. 
My time at SAE brought many of my skills in production, studio work, 
and audio design to a higher standard and also demonstrated my ability 
to work efficiently and autonomously to meet deadlines with ease.
